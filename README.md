## **SQL Data Analysis Project: Olist Dataset**

### **Project Objective**
The goal of this project was to analyze data from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform, to gain insights into customer orders, payments, and reviews. The focus was on understanding order patterns, payment methods, and customer feedback to help improve overall customer experience and business operations.

### **Dataset**
The project used multiple datasets from Olistâ€™s e-commerce operations, including:
- **Customers**: Information about customers such as city, state, and zip code.
- **Order Items**: Details about individual order items, including products, sellers, prices, and shipping information.
- **Order Payments**: Information on payment methods, installments, and amounts.
- **Order Reviews**: Data on customer reviews, including review scores and comments.

### **Methods Used**
1. **Table Creation**:
   - Created structured tables for customers, order items, order payments, and order reviews.
   - Defined **primary keys** for unique identification and **foreign keys** to maintain relationships between tables (e.g., orders and sellers).

2. **Data Import**:
   - Imported CSV datasets into the relevant tables using the `COPY` command.

3. **Data Cleaning and Validation**:
   - Checked for duplicates and null values in the dataset to ensure data quality.

4. **SQL Aggregation**:
   - Used `COUNT` to calculate the number of unique orders and grouped payments by order ID.
   - Performed `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to identify frequent payment methods and high-payment orders.

5. **Joins and Foreign Key Relationships**:
   - Used foreign keys to relate data between the `orders`, `orderitems`, `sellers`, and `orderreviews` tables.

### **Key Insights**
1. **Payment Methods**: 
   - The analysis identified the most common payment methods used by customers and tracked the use of installments across orders.
   
2. **Order Reviews**: 
   - Insights into customer reviews were derived by analyzing the review scores and comments, helping to understand customer satisfaction.
   
3. **Order Frequency**:
   - By counting unique orders and aggregating payments, the analysis provided insights into high-value orders and recurring customers.

### **Conclusion**
- The project revealed critical information about payment trends and customer satisfaction.
- Based on customer feedback (review scores), the company can improve its logistics and product quality.
- Insights into payment behavior (such as frequent use of installments) can help the business adjust its financial offerings to better serve its customer base.
